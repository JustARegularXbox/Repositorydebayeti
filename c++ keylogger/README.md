# C++ Keylogger

## This is a simple C++ keylogger for Windows XP and up

*Educational purposes only :)*

## How it works:

**_capture.cpp_** stores pressed keys in ascii format in the **_ascii.log_** file

**_decode.cpp_** converts **_ascii.log_** file into human-readable format (filename contains date - for instance: **_09.06.2020_18h.log_**)


*This is an early release, so expect **some** errors*...
